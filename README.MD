## My process

- I started with the mobile first approach and then moved to the desktop version.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I learned how to use the grid and flexbox to make the layout responsive.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

### Continued development

- I want to learn more about the grid and flexbox and how to use them to make the layout responsive.
